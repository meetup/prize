Prize
=====

A random picker for meetup door prize winners

This is a sketch written for [Spde][1] snapshot 2009-06-04 or higher. The
easiest way to use it is to clone

    git clone git://technically.us/git/Prize

within your sketches directory, something like `~/Documents/Processing/`.
After that it should appear in your sketchbook.

Prize must be configured with your [Meetup API credentials][2] and the ID
of the meetup where it should fetch its attendee list. Create a text file
`Prize/data/prize.conf` of the format

    key = "API-KEY-HERE"
    event_id = EVENT-ID-HERE

with quotes for the string API key and no quotes for the numeric event ID.

Enjoy, and please send improvement patches to nathan@technically.us or
@n8han on Twitter.
